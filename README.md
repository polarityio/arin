# Polarity ARIN Integration

The Polarity AIN integration allows Polarity to search the American Registry of Internet Numbers database to return information about IP addresses.

## Domain Tools Integration Options

### Lookup IPv6 Addresses

ARIN has the ability to provide details on IPv6 addresses in addition to IPv4, checking this option will look up IPv6 addresses in addition to the default option that lookups IPv4 addresses.

### Blacklist IPs

This is an alternate option that can be used to specify a comma-delimited list of domains that you do not want sent to ARIN.  You can block partial matches on the domain name by providing just the text you want to match on.  For example, if you want to blacklist a whole top level domain such as ".com" you can do so by adding the entry `.com`.  If left blank, no IPs will be blacklisted.

## Installation Instructions

Installation instructions for integrations are provided on the [PolarityIO GitHub Page](https://polarityio.github.io/).
